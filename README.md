## Assignment for Chapter 12 - Slight deviation from plan

I managed to get this assignment done [mostly], however one element is missing. 
I signed up for and downloaded everything needed for Heroku, and set up payment
information as is required, even for free accounts. However, when I tried to 
publish this project using Heroku via the command prompt, I received some errors
that seemed to indicate I needed to upgrade to a different plan. It didn't explain
much more than that, but maybe it has something to do with the country I'm in. At 
any rate, I didn't want to spend money on this single project, nor did I feel spending 
more time on this would improve it in any significant way. So as of now my blog can 
currently only be viewed on localhost.
