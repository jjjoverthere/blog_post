## Deviated from instructions

I downloaded and signed up for Heroku, and started using those tools. I was prompted to set up a credit card for billing, but would not be
billed as long as I remained within the limits for a free account. However, when I tried to host the application on Heroku, I ran into an 
on the command line as I was not a paid member [or something similar to that]. I wasn't about to commit any money to this project, so I went
back, revised my project somewhat, and now it can only be hosted on locally on localhost.
